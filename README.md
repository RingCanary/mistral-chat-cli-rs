## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Chat**: Send prompts to Mistral or Codestral APIs and receive streamed responses in real-time.
- **API Health Check**: Quickly test your connection to the Mistral and Codestral APIs.
- **Code Analysis**: Get insights and suggestions for your code snippets using the Codestral API.
- **Configuration Management**: Generate, view, and load configuration files to manage your API keys and settings.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Grab the code from GitHub and navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RingCanary/mistral-chat-cli-rs.git
   cd mistral-chat-cli-rs
   ```

2. **Build the Application**
   Compile the app with Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Run It**
   Start using the CLI right away:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release -- [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

The CLI follows this structure:
```
mistral-chat-cli-rs [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>
```

### Available Subcommands

- **`chat <PROMPT>`**
  Send a prompt to the AI. If "code" is in your prompt, it uses Codestral; otherwise, it defaults to Mistral.
  _Example_: Streams the response directly to your console.

- **`test`**
  Checks if the Mistral and Codestral APIs are reachable and reports the result.
  _Example_: Perfect for verifying your setup.

- **`code <CODE_SNIPPET>`**
  Analyzes a code snippet using the Codestral API and displays the feedback.
  _Example_: Great for debugging or improving code.

- **`config <CONFIG_COMMAND>`**
  Manage configuration files. Available config commands:
  - `generate [--path <FILE_PATH>]`: Generate a sample configuration file.
  - `view`: View the current configuration.
  - `load --file-path <FILE_PATH>`: Load a configuration file from a specified path.

### Options

- **`--debug`**
  Enable debug mode to see detailed logs of API requests and responses.
  _Example_: Useful for troubleshooting.

## üîë Configuration

To interact with the APIs, you‚Äôll need to set up your API keys in a configuration file or as environment variables:

- **`MISTRAL_API_KEY`**: Your key for the Mistral API.
- **`CODESTRAL_API_KEY`**: Your key for the Codestral API.

### How to Set Environment Variables

- **Linux/Mac**
  Add these lines to your shell (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
  ```bash
  export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_key
  export CODESTRAL_API_KEY=your_codestral_key
  ```

- **Windows**
  Use the Command Prompt to set them:
  ```cmd
  set MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_key
  set CODESTRAL_API_KEY=your_codestral_key
  ```

> **Tip**: Get your API keys from the Mistral and Codestral service providers and keep them secure!

## üåü Examples

Here‚Äôs how you can use the CLI in action:

### 1. Chat About Anything
```bash
cargo run --release -- chat "What‚Äôs the meaning of life?"
```
_Streams a thoughtful response from Mistral._

### 2. Code-Related Question
```bash
cargo run --release -- chat "How do I sort an array in Rust?"
```
_Triggers Codestral for a code-focused answer._

### 3. Test Your API Connection
```bash
cargo run --release -- test
```
_Confirms if Mistral and Codestral are online and ready._

### 4. Analyze a Code Snippet
```bash
cargo run --release -- code "fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { a + b }"
```
_Gets feedback from Codestral on your code._

### 5. Generate a Configuration File
```bash
cargo run --release -- config generate
```
_Creates a sample configuration file._

### 6. View Current Configuration
```bash
cargo run --release -- config view
```
_Displays the current configuration settings._

### 7. Load a Configuration File
```bash
cargo run --release -- config load --file-path path/to/config.toml
```
_Loads a configuration file from the specified path._

## üêû Debugging

Need to troubleshoot? Use the `--debug` flag to peek under the hood:
```bash
cargo run --release -- --debug chat "Test this out"
```
This prints detailed info about API calls, helping you spot issues fast.
